Version: 1.0.1
Author: Mitchell Cohen
Location: Newton, MA
Date: 01/11/25
Overview

mut8Current is a Python-based toolset and framework designed for working with Synth VST presets in XML format. The project aims to simplify the management, mutation, interpolation, and creation of synthesizer presets. This app will support workflows for analyzing, editing, and generating presets in a structured, user-friendly manner.
The project is modular and versioned, with detailed documentation for each milestone. Future versions will expand functionality, introducing advanced interpolation features, batch processing, and a highly customizable user interface.
